# Security Implementation Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security implementation for the SubPro Dashboard, including authentication, authorization, and role-based access control.

## 1. Authentication Flow

### 1.1 Page Load Authentication Check
- **Immediate Verification**: Upon loading any page, the system immediately verifies Firebase Authentication state
- **Automatic Redirect**: If user is not logged in, they are redirected to `login.html`
- **User Data Validation**: After login, the system fetches user document from `/users/{uid}` Firestore collection
- **Active Status Check**: Verifies the `isActive` field - if false, user is logged out immediately
- **Role Validation**: Ensures user has a valid role assigned

### 1.2 Authentication States
```javascript
// Authentication check flow
1. Check if user is authenticated (auth.currentUser)
2. Fetch user document from Firestore
3. Verify isActive status
4. Verify role assignment
5. Apply UI restrictions based on role
```

## 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### 2.1 Role Definitions
- **Admin**: Full system access, can manage users and all data
- **Team Leader**: Can view most data, manage team operations, limited delete permissions
- **Moderator**: Limited access to sales and renewals, basic operations only

### 2.2 Permission System
```javascript
// Permission categories
VIEW_DASHBOARD, VIEW_REPORTS, VIEW_SALES, VIEW_RENEWALS, VIEW_PROBLEMS, VIEW_ACCOUNTS, VIEW_EXPENSES
ADD_SALE, EDIT_SALE, DELETE_SALE, CONFIRM_SALE, EXPORT_DATA
ADD_ACCOUNT, EDIT_ACCOUNT, DELETE_ACCOUNT
ADD_EXPENSE, EDIT_EXPENSE, DELETE_EXPENSE
ADD_PRODUCT, DELETE_PRODUCT
ADD_PROBLEM
MANAGE_USERS, MANAGE_RENEWALS
```

### 2.3 Role-Permission Mapping
- **Admin**: All permissions
- **Team Leader**: Most permissions except user management and some delete operations
- **Moderator**: Limited to sales, renewals, and basic account management

## 3. UI Security Implementation

### 3.1 Dynamic UI Hiding
- **Tab Hiding**: Navigation tabs are hidden based on user permissions
- **Button Hiding**: Action buttons (add, edit, delete) are hidden using CSS classes
- **Form Hiding**: Entire forms are hidden if user lacks permissions
- **Content Hiding**: Section content is replaced with unauthorized access messages

### 3.2 CSS Classes for Role-Based Hiding
```css
.hide-delete-sale-buttons .delete-sale-btn { display: none !important; }
.hide-delete-account-buttons .delete-account-btn { display: none !important; }
.hide-delete-expense-buttons .delete-expense-btn { display: none !important; }
.hide-edit-sale-buttons .edit-sale-btn { display: none !important; }
.hide-edit-account-buttons .edit-account-btn { display: none !important; }
.hide-edit-expense-buttons .edit-expense-btn { display: none !important; }
.hide-confirm-sale-buttons .confirm-sale-btn { display: none !important; }
.hide-renewal-management .renewal-action-btn { display: none !important; }
```

### 3.3 Unauthorized Access Screens
- **Clear Messaging**: Users see specific messages about what they cannot access
- **Professional Design**: Consistent with the application's UI/UX
- **Action Guidance**: Provides clear next steps for users

## 4. Server-Side Security (Firestore Rules)

### 4.1 Security Rules Structure
```javascript
// Helper functions for authentication and authorization
function isAuthenticated() { return request.auth != null; }
function getUserData() { return get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data; }
function isUserActive() { return isAuthenticated() && getUserData().isActive == true; }
function hasRole(role) { return isAuthenticated() && getUserData().role == role; }
```

### 4.2 Collection-Level Security
- **Users Collection**: Only admins can read/write
- **Sales Collection**: Role-based read/write permissions
- **Accounts Collection**: Team leaders and admins can manage
- **Expenses Collection**: Team leaders and admins can manage
- **Products Collection**: Team leaders and admins can manage
- **Problems Collection**: All roles can create, limited management

### 4.3 Permission Matrix
| Action | Admin | Team Leader | Moderator |
|--------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| View Dashboard | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| View Reports | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| View Sales | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Add Sales | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Edit Sales | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Delete Sales | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| View Accounts | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Manage Accounts | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| View Expenses | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Manage Expenses | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Manage Users | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

## 5. Security Features

### 5.1 Client-Side Security
- **Permission Checks**: Every action is checked against user permissions
- **UI Restrictions**: Interface elements are hidden based on permissions
- **Access Control**: Tab switching is controlled by permission checks
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for unauthorized actions

### 5.2 Server-Side Security
- **Firestore Rules**: Comprehensive rules prevent unauthorized access
- **Role Validation**: Server-side role checking for all operations
- **Active Status Enforcement**: Inactive users are blocked at server level
- **Data Isolation**: Users can only access data they're authorized to see

### 5.3 Security Best Practices
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security (client + server)
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users get minimum required permissions
- **Fail Secure**: System defaults to denying access
- **Audit Trail**: All actions are logged and traceable

## 6. Implementation Details

### 6.1 Authentication Module (auth.js)
- `initAuth()`: Main authentication initialization
- `hasPermission()`: Permission checking function
- `applyUIRestrictions()`: UI hiding based on permissions
- `checkSectionAccess()`: Section access validation
- `showUnauthorizedAccessMessage()`: User feedback for denied access

### 6.2 Application Module (app.js)
- `checkAuthenticationOnLoad()`: Immediate auth check on page load
- `checkAndDisplayUnauthorizedScreens()`: Unauthorized access screen display
- `showUnauthorizedAccessScreen()`: UI for unauthorized access

### 6.3 User Management (users-management.js)
- Admin-only user management interface
- Role assignment and modification
- User activation/deactivation
- User deletion (admin only)

## 7. Security Considerations

### 7.1 Client-Side Limitations
- Client-side security can be bypassed by determined users
- Server-side rules provide the ultimate security layer
- All sensitive operations must be validated server-side

### 7.2 Server-Side Protection
- Firestore rules prevent unauthorized data access
- Role-based access control at database level
- Active status enforcement prevents disabled user access

### 7.3 Monitoring and Auditing
- All user actions are logged
- Authentication failures are tracked
- Permission changes are auditable

## 8. Deployment Checklist

### 8.1 Firestore Rules Deployment
1. Deploy `firestore.rules` to Firebase project
2. Test rules with different user roles
3. Verify all collections are properly protected
4. Test edge cases and error scenarios

### 8.2 Application Deployment
1. Ensure all permission checks are in place
2. Test UI hiding with different user roles
3. Verify unauthorized access screens work
4. Test authentication flow end-to-end

### 8.3 Security Testing
1. Test with different user roles
2. Verify inactive users cannot access system
3. Test permission bypass attempts
4. Verify server-side rules work correctly

## 9. Maintenance and Updates

### 9.1 Regular Security Reviews
- Review user permissions quarterly
- Audit access logs regularly
- Update security rules as needed
- Monitor for unauthorized access attempts

### 9.2 User Management
- Regular review of user roles
- Deactivate unused accounts
- Update permissions as roles change
- Train users on security best practices

This implementation provides comprehensive security for the SubPro Dashboard while maintaining a good user experience for authorized users.
